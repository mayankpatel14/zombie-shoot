# Zombie Shooter
This is a simple zombie shooting game made with JS and the HTML5 canvas! Read on how to make something similar on [dev.to](https://dev.to/phamn23/simple-zombie-shooter-49d).

## Canvas
New javascript programmers often abstract the native HTML5 canvas with p5.js. However, p5 is just a bloated dependency that simplifies what is already simple. This project showcases vanilla JavaScript, simple animation techniques, and keyboard input to create a cool game.
